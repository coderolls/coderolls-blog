In this article we will see why unit testing is important in Java. This is the first article of JUnit Tutorial Series.

## Why We Write JUnit Test Cases?

Whenever we are writing some code, it is really important to check whether the code it working fine or not.

Sometimes we can check it manually if our code is working as expected, but it is not an efficient way to check it.

As a developer, we are used to change the code as per change in business requirements received time to time. In this case, we need to again manually test all the edge and corner cases to check if the code is working or not. It will be a time consuming process and it will affect the team efficiency and releases.

To make this testing part efficient we can write unit test cases for our code.

**Unit test cases are the code written to test all the happy path, edge and corner cases of the feature or functionality. Basically, By writing a JUnit Test case, we are testing a unit of code on it's own.**

We can run a JUnit Test case in milliseconds to check if the code is working as expected. If the JUnit test case passes that means the feature or functionality is working as expected.

If  the unit test case fails, it shows there a single or more flaws / errors in the feature or functionality. Various Unit testing framework provides the detailed explanation of the flaws or error in the code with line number and error details.

JUnit Testing framework provide detailed explanations of the test failures with line numbers and reasons.

## Conclusion

**We should always write unit test cases for our code to test it efficiently.** JUnit is a unit testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. We will learn more about it in our next article.
