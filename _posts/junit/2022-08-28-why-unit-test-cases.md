In this article, we will see why unit testing is important in Java. This is the first article of the JUnit Tutorial Series.

## Why We Write JUnit Test Cases?

Whenever we are writing some code, it is essential to check whether the code is working fine or not.

Sometimes we can test it manually if our code is working as expected, but it is not an efficient way to test it.

As a developer, we are used to changing the code as per changes in business requirements. In this case, we need to test all the happy path, edge, and corner cases again to check whether the code is working fine or not. It will be a time-consuming process, and also it will affect the team's efficiency and release.

To make this testing part efficient, we can write unit test cases for our code.

**Unit test cases are the code written to test all the happy path, edge, and corner cases of the feature or functionality. Basically, by writing a JUnit Test case, we are testing a unit of code on its own.**

We can run a JUnit Test case in milliseconds to check if the code is working as expected. If the JUnit test case passes that means the feature or functionality is working as expected.

If the unit test case fails, it shows there are a single or more flaws/errors in the feature or functionality. Various Unit testing framework provides a detailed explanation of the flaws or error in the code with line number and error details.

JUnit Testing framework provides detailed explanations of the test failures with line numbers and reasons.

## Conclusion

**We should always write unit test cases for our code to test it efficiently.** JUnit is a unit-testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. We will learn more about it in our next article, [How To Write JUnit Test Case In Java? (With Example)](/junit-test-case-in-java/)
