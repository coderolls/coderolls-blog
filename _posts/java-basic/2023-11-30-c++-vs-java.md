In today's programming world, both C++ and Java are popular. 

Both are the Object object-oriented programming languages. Still, C++ and Java have a different set of features for different use cases.

Let's try to understand the basic difference between C++ and Java.

## Difference between C++ and Java (C++ vs Java)

| Property                  | C++                                                          | Java                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Platform Independence     | C++ is a platform-dependent programming language.              | C++ is a platform-independent programming language.            |
| Garbage Collection        | Programmer has to take care of the Garbage Collection. I.e. Removing unrefereed objects from the memory. | Java has a provision to remove unreferred objects from the memory. i.e. Garbage Collection |
| Multiple Inheritance      | C++ supports multiple inheritance.                           | Java does not support multiple inheritance.                  |
| Internal access to Memory | C++ has the concept of 'Pointers' to access the internal memory. | Java does not have Pointers.                                 |
| Object Oriented           | C++ is less object-oriented as we can write structural programs without using objects. | Java is more purer Object Oriented Language as compared to C++  (except for primitive variables). |
